Sleuth is a way to add a greater enhancement in logging by adding request id
into loggs for better tracability of loggs.

Only need to add dependency into pom and it starts adding below into the the
logs:
Application-name = Name of the application
Traceid = each request and response traceid is same when calling same service or one service to another service.
Spanid = Span Id is printed along with Trace Id. Span Id is different every request and response calling one service to another service.
Zipkin-export = By default it is false. If it is true, logs will be exported to the Zipkin server.

If want to export logs to ZipKin(Dapper), need to define ZipKin server url in 
appliaction.properties file
